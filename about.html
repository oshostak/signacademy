            <p class="text">
                Welcome to AccessGranted, your number one source for all things within your community that you should have easy accessability to. 
              We're dedicated to giving you the very best of what your community has to offer you, with a focus on public transportation. 
              Founded in 2020 by our incredible team, AccessGranted has come a long way from its beginnings, being just an idea. When we first started out, 
              our passion for creating a better community drove us to find a way to improve people's lives. Hearing how our teammate Devonne talk about 
              how the bus Routes in Boise, Idaho were a little funky, we knew we had to do something about it.
              We now serve customers all over Boise, Idaho, and are thrilled to be a part of the 
              very utilized wing of the public transportation industry.<br><br>

              We hope you enjoy what our website has to offer you as much as we enjoyed creating this service to you. 
              If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.<br><br>
              
              Sincerely,<br>
              The AccessGranted Team
