            <p class="text">
                Welcome to SignAcademy, your number one source for learning ASL. 
              We're dedicated to giving you the very best of what our community has to offer you, with a focus on ASL. 
              Founded in 2020 by our incredible team, SignAcademy has come a long way from its beginnings, being just an idea. When we first started out, 
              our passion for creating a better community drove us to find a way to educate people. Hearing how sign language is only spoken by 0.0015% of 
              the population at most, we were shocked. with that we knew we had to do something about it.
              Although we are only helping our community online, we are thrilled to be a part of the 
              ASL community.<br><br>

              We hope you enjoy what our website has to offer you as much as we enjoyed creating this service to you. 
              If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.<br><br>
              
              Sincerely,<br>
              The SignAcademy Team
